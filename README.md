# Web-1
This was the first project ever made by me. It was an assigment from a College Subject, to introduce student into web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript).

THe web page is basic and simple, not sofisticated at all and with no complexity, but it features some interesting things like a CRUD of gymnasts and some info of them ( using mock-api as persistence unit)client side rendering and filtering of content. Creating and editing will not work due to web app working as Single Page application, with partial rendering, unless it's hosted locally. In my case, i use Xampp to do so.
